This repo serves to demonstrate interesting things I find about
perception:

Hole in the Visual Field
========================

There is a blind spot on the retina where humans cannot perceive images.
The brain fills in this missing information and we are typically unaware
of its existence. The .gif below exposes this blind spot (based on:
<https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chvision.html>).

1.  Look at the image and notice the red dot is always there.
2.  Now close your right eye and focus on the + sign.  
3.  Notice that at a certain point the red dot disappears and then
    reappears?
