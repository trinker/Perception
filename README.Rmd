This repo serves to demonstrate interesting things I find about perception:

# Hole in the Visual Field

There is a blind spot on the retina where humans cannot perceive images.  The brain fills in this missing information and we are typically unaware of its existence. The .gif below exposes this blind spot (based on: https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/chvision.html).

1. Look at the image and notice the red dot is always there.
1. Now close your right eye and focus on the + sign.  
1. Notice that the at a certain point the red dot disappears and then reappears?
